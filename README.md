A very basic and unoptimised 2D game engine created while following: https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-2d-game-engine

I wanted to learn a little more about C++ as well as some game engine basics such as entity component systems, so this engine was created more for learning purposes than for practical purposes.

On ubuntu the following libaries are required in order to use the engine:
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-image-dev liblua5.3-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
